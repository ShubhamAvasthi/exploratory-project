# exploratory-project
This is my Exploratory Project on Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of the reaction of carbon monoxide and oxygen to form carbon dioxide.

The presentation of the project I gave in my III<sup>rd</sup> semester can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18e0D337eUUL0epWoWVzpS27ylj1oI3GO/view?usp=sharing).

I worked on this project in my sophomore year in college when I was not very well aware of good coding practices, which shows in the code.
